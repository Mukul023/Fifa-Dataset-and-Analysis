## Data Source
  Data was scraped from Kaggle.com and then cleaned.
## Inspiration
  I am a huge FIFA fanatic. While playing career mode I realised that I picked great young players early on every single time and since a lot of digital learning relies on how our brain works, I thought scouting great qualities in players would be something that can be worked on. Since then I started working on scraping the website and here is the data. I hope we can build something on it.
